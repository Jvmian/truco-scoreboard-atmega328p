# Truco Scoreboard – ATmega328P

An electronic Truco scoreboard developed using the ATmega328P microcontroller, featuring a custom PCB, embedded firmware, and a fully functional physical prototype.

This project was designed with a focus on embedded systems fundamentals, hardware-software integration, and practical validation through simulation and real-world testing.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Truco Scoreboard is a dedicated embedded system designed to count and display game points in a simple and reliable way.  
The development process followed a structured engineering workflow:

1. Circuit design and validation using **TinkerCAD**
2. Firmware development in **C++**
3. Custom PCB design
4. Assembly and testing of a physical prototype
5. Functional validation through real operation

## 🧠 System Architecture

- The ATmega328P is responsible for reading user inputs and controlling the scoreboard logic.
- Output devices display the current game score.
- The firmware manages point counting, state transitions, and system reliability.
- The electronic schematic was created and validated in TinkerCAD before assembling the physical prototype.

## 🧪 Simulation

The same TinkerCAD project file was used for:
- Electronic schematic development
- Circuit simulation
- Functional validation prior to hardware assembly

This ensured correct system behavior before building the physical prototype.

---

## 🔧 Hardware

- Custom-designed PCB
- Physical prototype assembled and tested
- Fully functional system operating independently (standalone embedded solution)

The original PCB design file is included in the repository for reference and documentation purposes.

## 🎥 Media

- Photos of the assembled prototype
- Video demonstration showing the system in operation

These materials validate the real-world functionality of the project.
